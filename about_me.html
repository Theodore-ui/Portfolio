                <p>With exceptional problem-solving skills, I am able to analyse problems and break them down into their component parts.
                 Then solve each part in a logical sequence to ensure the problem is solved in the most efficient and accurate way. Maintaining
                 focus while working independently comes easily to me as I am motivated to work to the best of my ability rather then any minimum
                 requirement. When working in cooperation with others, I utilise my communication and organisational skills to ensure they are
                 able to make the most of there time. Also, when I require assistance, I ask for it immediately to ensure that I am making the
                 most of my time. With a sharp eye for detail, I can quickly identify discrepancies and highlight issues that may have caused
                 these discrepancies and further establish what problems have or could have occurred as a result.</p> 
                 
                <p>Previous I worked as a Planning Administrator at Transam Trucking Limited I worked within strict legal regulations and
                 company policy to create detailed travel plans to assist transportation of equipment across Europe and the UK. I made certain
                 everything was accurate, clear and sent out to relevant parties to meet a hard deadline. Inspired by my interest in consistent
                 and logical work, I decided to persue a career in computer programming. This led me to apply for the 
                 <a class="inline_scs" href="scs_scheme.html">Scion Scheme</a>, a project run by Netmatters to provide the necessary skills training to enter the
                 computer programing industry. I was accepted onto the course and am now training to be a web developer.</p>

                <h2 class="about_me_section_title">Aspirations</h2>
                <p>I aspire to be a computer programmer. I would find the process of identifying the limitations and problems of current
                 software, working out how these problems can be solved, and then writing code for purpose-driven software and extremely
                 satisfying process. Being a computer programmer requires you to be extremely logical when creating software as you may be
                 required to adapt your code as a result of a change of requirement; being a computer programmer would allow me to utilize
                 my logical-think and problem-solving skills.</p>
                
                <p>To create the best code possible, working alongside other programmers is often required. This is to the effect of consolidating
                 solutions to different aspects of the software being developed and deciding which solutions should be implemented into the final
                 iteration of the software. This is an atmosphere I would thrive in: I am able to work independently and therefore generate my own
                 solutions and also work in collaboration with others when combining our ideas to create code for programs and software that we are
                 unable to create independently.</p>
